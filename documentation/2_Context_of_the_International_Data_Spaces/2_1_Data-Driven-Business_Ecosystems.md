## Data-Driven Business Ecosystems #
数据驱动的商业生态系统

Novel digital products and services often emerge in business ecosystems,
which organizations enter to jointly fulfill the needs of customers
better than they can do on their own. In such ecosystems, which emerge
and dissolve much faster than traditional value creating networks, the
partners have a clear focus on end-to-end customer processes in order to
jointly develop innovative products and services. Actors in such
ecosystems can be businesses (also direct competitors), research
organizations, intermediaries (electronic marketplaces, for example),
governmental agencies, and customers.

新型数字产品和服务通常是在业务生态系统中出现的，组织进入这些生态系统是为了共同满足客户需求，以比他们独立完成更好的业务成果。在这样的生态系统中，合作伙伴们的关注点在于端到端的客户流程，以共同开发创新的产品和服务。在这样的生态系统中，参与者可以是企业（包括直接竞争对手）、研究机构、中介机构（例如电子市场）、政府机构和客户。这些生态系统的出现和消失速度比传统的价值创造网络更快。

Ecosystems are characterized by the fact that no member is capable of
creating innovation on its own. Instead, the ecosystem as a whole needs
to team up. In other words: Every member has to contribute something for
the benefit of all. Ideally, ecosystems function in an equilibrium state
of mutual benefits for all members.

生态系统的特点是没有一个成员能够独自创造创新。相反，整个生态系统需要团队合作。换句话说：每个成员都必须为了所有人的利益做出贡献。理想情况下，生态系统应当处于所有成员均获得相互利益的平衡状态。

A data-driven business ecosystem is an ecosystem in which data is the
strategic resource used by the members to jointly create innovative
value offerings. Key to success is to share and jointly maintain data
within such an ecosystem, as end-to-end customer process support can
only be achieved if the partners team up and jointly utilize their data
resource (as shown by a number of examples in the Figure below).

数据驱动的业务生态系统是一种生态系统，其中数据是成员用于共同创建创新价值提议的战略资源。成功的关键在于在这样的生态系统中共享和共同维护数据，因为只有合作伙伴们团队合作并共同利用其数据资源才能实现端到端的客户流程支持（如下图所示的若干示例）。
