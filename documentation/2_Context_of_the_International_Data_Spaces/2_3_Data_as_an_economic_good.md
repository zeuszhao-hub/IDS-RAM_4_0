## Data as an Economic Good ##
数据作为一种经济商品

It is indisputable that data has a value, and that data management
generates costs. Today, data is traded in the market like a commodity;
it has a price, and many companies monitor the costs incurred for data
management. However, data, being an intangible good, differs from
tangible goods with regard to a number of properties, among which the
fact that data is non-rival is considered the most important one. The
value of data increases as it is being used (and, in many cases, as the
number of user increases). While these differences hinder the adoption
and application of legal provisions to the management and use of data,
they do not dispute the fact that data is an economic good.

毫无疑问，数据具有价值，并且数据管理会产生成本。今天，数据在市场上被像商品一样交易，它有一个价格，许多公司对数据管理的成本进行监控。然而，由于数据是一种无形的商品，与有形商品相比，具有一些不同的特性，其中被认为最重要的是数据是不可竞争的。数据的价值随着使用而增加（在许多情况下，随着用户数量的增加而增加）。虽然这些差异阻碍了法律规定在数据管理和使用方面的应用和采用，但并不否认数据是一种经济商品的事实。

Depending on what type data is of, or what category it can be subsumed
under, the value it contributes to the development of innovative
products and services can vary. Therefore, the need for protection of
data is not the same across all data types and data categories. Public
data, for example, which can be accessed by anyone, requires a lower
level of protection than private data or club data.

根据数据的类型或其所属的类别，它对于开发创新产品和服务所做出的价值贡献有所不同。因此，对于所有数据类型和数据类别的保护需求是不同的。例如，任何人都可以访问的公共数据需要比私人数据或组织内数据的保护级别较低。

Because of these differences and distinctions made with regard to data,
a generally accepted understanding of the value of data has not been
established so far. Nevertheless, there is a growing need to determine
the value of data, given the rapid developments taking place Data-driven 
Business Ecosystems.

由于对数据的这些差异和区别的看法，迄今为止尚未建立起数据价值的普遍认识。然而，考虑到数据驱动的商业生态系统正在迅速发展，越来越需要确定数据的价值。
